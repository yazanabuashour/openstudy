- For all committed docs, reports, Beads notes, and artifact references, use repo-relative paths or neutral repo-relative placeholders. Never use machine-absolute filesystem paths.
- Do work on the current branch. Do not create or switch to another branch unless explicitly instructed.
- If repo-pinned developer tools are later declared in `mise.toml`, run commands through `mise exec -- ...` so agents use the same tool versions as local docs and CI.

## OpenStudy Product Goal

OpenStudy is a local-first AgentOps memorization runtime for agents. The
intended product helps agents practice and retain operational knowledge, and it
owns memorization practice state such as cards, review
scheduling, grading history, and automation state. Cards may later link back to
OpenClerk or vault source notes for provenance, but OpenStudy owns mutable
review practice data.

## OpenStudy Planning Boundary

OpenStudy currently has promoted internal storage and scheduler code from
`os-ful`. Do not add a runner, skill, automation runtime, product API, install
script, release workflow, or eval harness until the Beads ADR, POC, eval, and
decision chain explicitly promotes that work.

Use OpenHealth as the infrastructure reference: installed JSON runner,
single-file skill, local SQLite storage, immutable release posture,
repo-relative docs, and eval gates. Use OpenClerk as the decision-process
reference: ADR, POC, eval, decision, then blocked implementation placeholders.
Any future release work must follow the OpenHealth immutable-release posture,
but no release assets, install path, or release workflow exist yet.

## Repository Hygiene

OpenStudy is intended for open-source distribution. This repository must not
contain personal source inventories, private study material, private vault
content, delivery or review logs, workspace backups, run history, local SQLite
databases, credentials, private infrastructure details, raw private logs, or
sensitive sample content.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for maintainer issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- If you are acting as a maintainer or local coding agent, use `bd` for task tracking instead of ad hoc markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete steps 1-5 below, then stop for manual review before running `git add`, `git commit`, `bd dolt push`, or `git push`. The workflow is paused for manual review at step 5 with uncommitted local changes, and the work session is NOT complete until steps 6-10 are finished after review approval and `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Prepare manual review** - Run `git status`, summarize changed files and quality gates, confirm no commit or push has been performed, and leave files uncommitted for manual review
5. **Manual review** - Stop here by default with uncommitted local changes, report that the workflow is paused for manual review, and wait for explicit instruction to complete the remaining steps
6. **Commit approved changes** - After explicit review approval, stage the intended files and create a local commit
7. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
8. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
9. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
10. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- The workflow pauses for manual review after step 5 with uncommitted local changes, and the work session is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- Do NOT run `git add`, `git commit`, `bd dolt push`, or `git push` before manual review unless explicitly instructed
- Do NOT continue past `Manual review` unless explicitly instructed to complete the remaining workflow steps
- Once instructed to continue after review, stage, commit, pull/rebase, run `bd dolt push`, and `git push`; do NOT stop again with local-only changes
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" after review approval - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
